# Vehicle Dynamics Blender

Reconstruct vehicle dynamics from sensors data by animating an object on Blender.

Current version use accellerometer, gyroscope and GNSS module.

The sensors data must be in [this format (FullInertial)](https://github.com/physycom/file_format_specifications/blob/master/formati_file.md).

## Install

1. Download latest .zip release from [here](https://github.com/physycom/vehicle_dynamics_Blender/releases) 
2. Install .zip as a blender common add-on as explained also [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/preferences/addons.html).
During the add-on activation / deactivation dependencies are installed/uninstalled so you could have to wait a while.

## Usage

Once the add-on is istalled a new panel will be present in the lower section of `Tools`.

`Animate object` creates animation data for the active object.
