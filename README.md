The sensors data must be in [this format (FullInertial)](https://github.com/physycom/file_format_specifications/blob/master/formati_file.md).

## Install

1. Download latest .zip release from [here](https://github.com/physycom/vehicle_dynamics_Blender/releases) 
2. Install .zip as a blender common blender add-on as explained also [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/preferences/addons.html)
